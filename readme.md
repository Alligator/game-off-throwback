Swerve wildly! Drink beers! Yell at your kids! Don't learn from your mistakes!

This is my entry to the 2017 GitHub Game Jam. It is written for the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console.

## Building

If you want to modify this you can of course modify the p8 file directly, but if like me you prefer to work with a regular lua file I have included a python script that will copy the contents of throwback.lua into the `__lua__` section of throwback.p8. Just run `python build.py`.
