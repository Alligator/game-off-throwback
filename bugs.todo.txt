add some stuff in the sky, demons in hell, angels in heaven maybe?
sound for some of the events (especially kids makin noise)
add stuff to avoid on the road?

x sound effects on the events (arrows, event complete, event failed)
x build up the messages for events so it shows a whole sentence
x noise when you mess up the arrow combo?
x put a border on the timer bar

x powerup sound
add more events to the gates of hell, hell and heaven -- i kinda like the one event scenes
x add name to title screen
x balance the events i guess -- ehh kinda
x ugh still getting the wrong hazards in segs
x add a regular ass heaven scene w/ blue sky n white floor
x make current heaven candy land with candy canes n shit?
x ending music
x pickup detection is weird/inconsistent
x the beer event always moves you to the right if you fail
stuff is still flickery -- don't care
x transition from the title to in game is still ropey
x signs aren't being placed on sharp curves - seems to favour short corners?
x speed is hard to read sometimes -- especially in heaven
too easy to get more time -- ehhhh not really
x game ending when an event failure is happening might get weird - seems fine, the FSM for events just stops updating, could stop drawing it?
x events should change as time progresses
x arrows are hard to read against the hell background
x need some better last chances to get time
x can't reset
x need some sort of indication that a time powerup is coming
add a text notification when you hit stuff "dang building!!", "dang cactus!!"
timer flashes something other than 0 when it runs out
