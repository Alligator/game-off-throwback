add more events to the gates of hell, hell and heaven
ugh still getting the wrong hazards in segs
add a regular ass heaven scene w/ blue sky n white floor
make current heaven candy land with candy canes n shit?
x pickup detection is weird/inconsistent
x the beer event always moves you to the right if you fail
stuff is still flickery -- don't care
x transition from the title to in game is still ropey
x signs aren't being placed on sharp curves - seems to favour short corners?
speed is hard to read sometimes -- especially in heaven
too easy to get more time -- ehhhh not really
x game ending when an event failure is happening might get weird - seems fine, the FSM for events just stops updating, could stop drawing it?
x events should change as time progresses
x arrows are hard to read against the hell background
x need some better last chances to get time
can't reset
x need some sort of indication that a time powerup is coming
add a text notification when you hit stuff "dang building!!", "dang cactus!!"
timer flashes something other than 0 when it runs out
