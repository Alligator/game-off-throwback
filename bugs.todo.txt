x pickup detection is weird/inconsistent
x the beer event always moves you to the right if you fail
stuff is still flickery
x transition from the title to in game is still ropey
x signs aren't being placed on sharp curves - seems to favour short corners?
speed is hard to read sometimes
too easy to get more time
game ending when an event failure is happening might get weird - seems fine, the FSM for events just stops updating, could stop drawing it?
events should change as time progresses
arrows are hard to read against the hell background
need some better last chances to get time
can't reset
need some sort of indication that a time powerup is coming
add a text notification when you hit stuff "dang building!!", "dang cactus!!"
timer flashes something other than 0 when it runs out
